# Atlas.Cli 1.x

This is the command-line interface package for Atlas. It is intended for use
in your development environments, not your production ones.

## Installation

This package is installable and autoloadable via
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) as
[atlas/cli](https://packagist.org/packages/atlas/cli).

Add it to the `require-dev` section of your root-level `composer.json`
to install the `atlas-skeleton` command-line tool.

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "atlas/cli": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

## Creating Skeleton Classes

You can create your data source classes by hand, but it's going to be tedious to
do so. Instead, use the `atlas-skeleton` command to read the table information
from the database.

Create a PHP file to return an array of connection parameters suitable for PDO:

```php
<?php
// /path/to/conn.php
return [
    'mysql:dbname=testdb;host=localhost',
    'username',
    'password'
];
?>
```

You can then invoke the skeleton generator using that connection. Specify a
target directory for the skeleton files, and pass the namespace name for the
data source classes. You can pass an explicit table name to keep the generator
from trying to guess the name.

```bash
./vendor/bin/atlas-skeleton.php \
    --conn=/path/to/conn.php \
    --dir=src/App/DataSource \
    --table=threads \
    App\\DataSource\\Thread
```

> N.b.: The backslashes (`\`) at the end of the lines are to allow the command
> to be split across multiple lines in Unix. If you are on Windows, omit the
> trailing backslashes and enter the command on a single line.

That will create this directory and two classes in `src/App/DataSource/`:

```
└── Thread
    ├── ThreadMapper.php
    └── ThreadTable.php
```

The Mapper class will be empty, and the Table class will a description of the
specified `--table`.

Do that once for each SQL table in your database.

If you pass `--full` to `atlas-skeleton`, it will additionally generate empty
`MapperEvents`, `Fields`, `Record`, `RecordSet`, and `TableEvents` classes. (These are
useful only if you want to add custom behaviors.)
